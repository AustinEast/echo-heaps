# What is this

- This is a game that demonstrates how to add a physics(echo) engine to heaps.io(since it doesnt have one)

## How to start
```
# Install deps from both hashlink and web and the shared libs
$ haxelib install all 

# To produce hashlink target
$ haxe hl.hxml

# To produce browser target
$ haxe js.hxml 
```

### This can also be configured to produce targets for android web and all consoles
